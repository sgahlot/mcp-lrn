* Lists all the `resource templates` exposed by the server
* Lists all the `tools` exposed by the server
* Initialize the database (_if it is not yet initialized_) by inserting 10 records in the `employee` table
* Retrieves all the employees using the server resource
* Retrieves a single employee (_with id=1_) using the server template resource
* Deletes the employee with id=1
* Again, retrieves all the employees using the server resource
* Again, retrieves a single employee (_with id=1_) using the server template resource
