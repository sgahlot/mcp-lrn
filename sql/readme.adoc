This directory contains `MCP` SQL server showing following MCP functionalities:

* Provides a resource to return all the Employees
* Provides a resource to return a single Employee based on employee_id
* Delete an Employee based on employee_id


== Pre-requisites

=== Sync project
Run `uv sync` in the `sql` directory to create the virtual environment

== Run example

=== Modify Claude config

Execute the following commands to add the visual server in Claude config:

[source,console]
----
# Enable virtual environment to run mcp command in order to install the server
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# Install visual code server in Claude config.
# ** Use `where uv` if running this command on Windows
$ `which uv` run mcp install db-server.py
----

=== Fix Claude config
The following error is encountered when running this MCP server from Claude Desktop:

* `Failed to run server: No module named 'aiosqlite'`

In order to resolve this error, we need to manually modify the Claude config file. We first need to
find the Claude config location.

==== Find Claude config location
Find the correct location of the Claude config by performing these steps:

* Open up Claude Desktop application
* Open `Settings`
* Click on `Developer` in the side panel
* Click on `Edit Config` button

This will open up the folder where Claude config resides. 

==== Modify Claude config

Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file present in the folder that was opened in the previous step.

Modify this json, for `Employees MCP Server` mcpServer, as shown below:

* Change the json element shown below (_this element should be added by `uv run mcp install db-server.py` command_):

[source,json]
----
# Existing config
    "Employees MCP Server": {
      "command": "<UV_BIN_DIRECTORY>/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "<MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR>/sql/db-server.py"
      ]
    }
----

* **to this**:

[source,json]
----

# NEW config
    "Employees MCP Server": {
      "command": "<MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR>/sql/.venv/bin/mcp",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "<MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR>/sql/db-server.py"
      ]
    }
----

  The <MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR> in the above snippet is where you have cloned the `mcp-lrn` repository.


=== Restart Claude Desktop
Quit and re-run Claude Desktop to use the modified config.

=== Employees MCP Server tools
Once the Claude Desktop is running, click on the `Search and tools` icon, as shown in the image 1, 
to see the `Employees MCP Server`:

Click on `Employees MCP Server` and you shoulbe be able to see the tools as shown in the image 2:

=== Run some queries

Now that everything is setup and all the tools are available to use, use the following queries to get
information about the Employees.

* `Get all the employees`
  ** Claude should prompt you for allowing to run the `get_employees` tool (as shown in image 3).
     Click on `Allow once` to have Claude run the tool

image::claude_allow_once.png[allow_once]
**Image 3**: Allow get_employees tool execution

  Once the tools is executed, Claude should display all the employee records from the Employee table.

* `Retrieve the employee with id 2`
  ** Allow Claude to execute the tools by clicking on `Allow once`, when prompted.
  ** The employee details with id=2 should be displayed
* `Delete the employee with id 2`
  ** Allow Claude to execute the tools by clicking on `Allow once`, when prompted
  ** The employee with id=2 should be deleted (as shown in image 4).

image::claude_delete_employee.png[delete_employee]
**Image 4**: Delete employee

* `Retrieve the employee with id 2`
  ** Allow Claude to execute the tools by clicking on `Allow once`, when prompted.
  ** The employee with ID 2 should NOT be found in the database (as shown in image 5).

  This shows Claude remembers about the context based on previous interactions.
