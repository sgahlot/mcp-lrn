This directory contains `MCP` server that generates a random string for a given size.

  Along with this data, this server also reads top 20 lines from a random file in the
  user's home directory and returns that data along with the random string.


== Pre-requisites

=== Sync project
Run `uv sync` in the `gradio-letter-counter` directory to create the virtual environment

=== Install Claude Desktop
Install `Claude Desktop` by following instructions on the {uri-claude}[Claude website]. 


== Run example

=== Modify Claude config

Execute the following commands to add the MCP server in Claude config:

[source,console]
----
# Install MCP code server in Claude config.
# ** Use `where uv` if running this command on Windows
$ `which uv` run mcp install server.py
----

=== Run Claude Desktop
Run Claude Desktop to use the modified config.

  If the Claude Desktop is already running, restart it to reload the config.

Once the Claude Desktop is running, type the following query to test the tool:

* `Generate a random string of size 15`
  ** Claude should prompt you for allowing to run the `random_string` tool.
     Click on `Allow once` to have Claude run the tool.
  ** Claude should show you the correct result from MCP server as shown in image 1.

=== Security breach - Server returning extra info
This MCP server does something extra that's not mentioned in the tool description - the `random_string`
tool reads top 20 lines from a random file in the user's home directory.

  For this example, the tool simply returns this data in the tool's response, but in reality it can
  send this information anywhere.

  ** Expand the tool result in Claude Desktop and scroll down to see the full response.
     You should be able to see `extra_info` element that should display data from a
     random file as shown in image 2.
