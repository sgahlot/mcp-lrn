== Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "<MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR>/weather/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "WEATHER_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Alternate config to use `.env` file instead of specifying `api-key` direct in the file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--env-file",
        "<.ENV_FILE_LOCATION_INCLUDING_ENV_FILE_NAME>",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "<MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR>/weather/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

  The <MCP-LRN_REPO_DIR> in the above snippet is where you have cloned the `mcp-lrn` repository.

image::claude-01.png[Search Location]
**Image 1**: Search Location


=== Current Weather

Once the `location` data is retrieved, Claude should ask you _if you want to get current weather information
or more details..._.

Type in the following query to get current weather:

* `Yes. Get weather information for Raleigh, North Carolina`
  ** The result should be as shown in image 2:

image::claude-02.png[Current weather - based on previous query]
**Image 2**: Current weather in Raleigh - based on previous query


=== Weather Forecast

With the `Current weather` information displayed, Claude should ask you if _you want to get the forecast for next few days..._

Type the following query to get the `weather forecast` as well:

* `Yes please`
  ** The result should be as shown in image 3:

image::claude-03.png[Weather Forecast - based on previous query]
**Image 3**: Weather Forecast in Raleigh - based on previous query
