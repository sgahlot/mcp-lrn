This repository contains various `MCP` examples that can be run, by using `uv`, in each of the directories.

== Pre-requisites

=== Install uv
Install `uv` by following instructions on the {uri-uv}[uv website]. 


== Run examples

Each example is fully contained in a sub-directory (e.g. echo, sql). Follow the steps given below
to run a specific example:

* Change directory, e.g. `cd echo`
* Sync up the environment using the following command:
  ** `uv sync`

The `uv sync` command performs the following tasks:

* Find or download an appropriate Python version
